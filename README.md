# CEGrad
A voluntary project for the graduation of B.Sc. students, 2014 beginners, of the Computer Engineering department at Sharif University of Technology. It was a platform where all the students could participate in polls and write memoirs and remembrance notes for their friends and classmates. At last, all of these provided contents formed a 160-page document in the remembrance of our class, which was given to every student at the graduation ceremony.
