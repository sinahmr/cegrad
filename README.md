# CEGrad
A voluntary project for the graduation of B.Sc. students, 2014 beginners, of the Computer Engineering department at Sharif University of Technology.
It was a platform in which all the students could participate in polls, and in writing memoirs and remembrance notes for their friends and classmates.
At last, all of these provided contents formed a 160-page document in the remembrance of our class, which was given to every student in the graduation ceremony.
